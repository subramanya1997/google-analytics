Authentication Service Business Logic Module.

This module contains the core business logic for the authentication service,
including OAuth authentication, configuration validation, and tenant management.

Main Components:
- auth_service.py: AuthenticationService class with OAuth and configuration logic

The business logic is separated from the API layer to enable better testing,
maintainability, and potential reuse across different interfaces.
